# Facebook Auth for Ionic & Firebase

This is an example app that uses the native Facebook plugin to sign a user in using Facebook authentication.

You'll need to clone the repo and do `npm install`.

After that you'll need to install the Facebook plugin and do a bunch of other config.

Details about it can be found [in this guide](https://javebratt.com/ionic-2-firebase-3-facebook/).
